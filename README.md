### **✨ Key Features**

* **Real-time Usage Monitoring**: View your total Instagram usage time for the day at a glance to stay aware of your habits.
* **Intentional Access**: Before opening Instagram, you are required to set a specific purpose and a strict time limit for your session.
* **Smart Restrictions**: Once your pre-set time limit expires, the app automatically restricts access to Instagram using the **Family Controls (Screen Time) API**.
* **Repetitive Discipline**: To regain access, you must repeat the goal-setting process, ensuring every minute spent on the app is intentional.

### **🛡️ Privacy Policy**

We prioritize your privacy and data security. 

* **On-Device Processing**: All usage monitoring and app restriction logic are performed locally on your device. We do not have access to your browsing history or personal data.
* **No Data Collection**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal activity logs, screenshots, or screen recordings to external servers.
